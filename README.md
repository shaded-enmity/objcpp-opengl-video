Simple self-contained video playback via OpenGL using ObjC / C++ for iOS

# Info

My backup HD got corrupted, so here's what I managed to salvage frome ditor swap files, the code most likely doesn't work, heck it won't probably even compile.
Also note that audio playback didn't work and that the video playbacks at maximum possible speed (frame read), but these should be rather easy problems to solve.
Since I no longer do iOS development I can't provide better/working example, but this should be enough to get you started, you just need to render a quad with the generated texture on it.
